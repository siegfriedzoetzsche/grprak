* Questions of interest
The goal of the lab course is to investigate set of rules (chemical reactions) and for "interesting" combinations answer the following questions:
** Chemical reaction network graph languages
- Does the rule under investigation lead to an infinite amount of molecules?
- Is there a starting molecule where the graph language (yielded by the rule) is infinite?
- Is there a combination of (two rules) where every single rule yields a finite language, but both rules together give something infinite?
- Systematic summary which rules are finite, which are infinite
** Minimality/maximality of graph grammars / rules
- Given a set of rules that yield an infinite language, which is the minimal set of rules yielding it / yielding an infinite language? (Minimality in this context means that there is no (proper) subset that generates the language)
- Given a set of rules that yield an infinite language, which is the maximal set of rules yielding a finite language? (Maximality in this context means that there is no rule that (unionized with the given set of rules) yield an infinite set)
** Dependence on starting molecules
Answer how the language generated by the rule / set of rules depends on the starting molecule
- case 0: trivial: no rule can be applied
- case 1: rules can be applied, but finite set is yielded; iterate until exhausted -> finite language
- case 2: Is there a starting set that will give an infinite chemical universe?
- Extend systematic summary of finiteness of rules depending on the starting molecule(s) 
** Computational aspects of graph languages
- (until tuesday:) What are good stopping conditions for the analysis of the networks?
- Since infinite grammar can't be computationally generated: what are good bounds for stopping the computation?
  - Limit the size of chemical networks with a total number of graphs 
  - Limit the size of chemical networks with a total size of molecules
- Create a comparison of stopping conditions (how large is network or what size of molecules to expand (coordinate between groups))

* Point to answer for the final presentation:
- Analysis of finiteness of rules
- For infinite rules: do the finite subsets contain any other networks inside of them?
- Comparison of these rules to rules with several infinite cycles, since it is easier to find autocatalytic cycles in these

* Coordination within the group (Coordinate via blackboard?)
- Which combinations of groups are interesting / boring? (interesting: maximal finiteness / minimal infiniteness?)
- Who investigates which combination of rules?
- How can we parallelize the search tree through the lab course (numerical experiments & and arguing whether and why rule set / universe is (in-)finite)
